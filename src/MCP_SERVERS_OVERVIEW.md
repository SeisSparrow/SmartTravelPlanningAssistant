# 🔌 MCP Servers Overview - Smart Travel Planning Assistant

## What are MCP Servers?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers** are specialized microservices that provide specific functionality through a standardized protocol. They act as intelligent agents that can be called upon to perform specific tasks, making your application modular and scalable.

## 🏗️ MCP Servers Used in This Project

### 1. **Travel Orchestrator Server**
- **File**: `src/travel-orchestrator.ts`
- **Purpose**: Main coordination server that combines data from all other servers
- **Tools Available**:
  - `plan_trip` - Creates comprehensive travel plans
  - `get_travel_insights` - Provides destination insights
  - `compare_destinations` - Compares multiple destinations
- **GitHub**: Custom implementation (included in this project)

### 2. **Weather Server**
- **File**: `src/weather-server.ts`
- **Purpose**: Provides weather information and forecasts for travel planning
- **Tools Available**:
  - `get_travel_weather` - Weather data for destinations
  - `get_weather_alerts` - Weather alerts and warnings
  - `compare_destination_weather` - Weather comparison across locations
- **GitHub**: Custom implementation (included in this project)

### 3. **Currency Exchange Server**
- **File**: `src/currency-server.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles currency conversion and exchange rate information
- **Tools Available**:
  - `convert_currency` - Convert between currencies
  - `get_destination_currency` - Currency info for destinations
  - `get_travel_budget_conversion` - Convert travel budgets
  - `get_currency_trends` - Exchange rate trends
- **GitHub**: Custom implementation (included in this project)

### 4. **Translation Server**
- **File**: `src/translation-server.ts`
- **Purpose**: Provides translation services for international travel
- **Tools Available**:
  - `translate_text` - Translate text between languages
  - `detect_language` - Detect language of text
  - `get_travel_phrases` - Essential travel phrases
  - `translate_destination_info` - Translate destination information
- **GitHub**: Custom implementation (included in this project)

## 🌟 Key Features of Our MCP Servers

### **1. Modular Design**
- Each server handles a specific domain (weather, currency, translation)
- Easy to maintain and update independently
- Can be scaled or replaced without affecting others

### **2. Standardized Communication**
- All servers use the same MCP protocol
- Consistent request/response format
- Easy to add new servers or tools

### **3. Parallel Processing**
- Multiple servers can be called simultaneously
- Non-blocking operations for better performance
- Efficient resource utilization

### **4. Error Handling & Fallbacks**
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Mock data fallback for demonstration purposes
- Comprehensive error logging

## 🚀 How MCP Servers Work

### **Communication Flow:**
1. **Client** sends request to main application
2. **Main app** identifies which MCP tools are needed
3. **Parallel calls** are made to relevant MCP servers
4. **Data aggregation** happens in the orchestrator
5. **Response** is formatted and sent back to client

### **Example Workflow:**
```javascript
// Client requests trip planning
const tripPlan = await use_mcp_tool('plan_trip', {
  destination: 'Paris',
  startDate: '2024-06-01',
  budget: 2000
});

// This triggers parallel calls to:
// - Weather Server (get weather forecast)
// - Currency Server (get exchange rates)
// - Translation Server (get essential phrases)
// All in parallel!
```

## 📁 GitHub Availability
